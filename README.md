Project Name: Nutria


The Problem:


With the growing food industry in the United States, processed foods are becoming more and more common in household kitchens. While there is plenty of evidence that the artificial ingredients in these foods are detrimental to health, food companies keep trying to mask these harmful additives. Especially with the new trend of healthy eating, corporations market their products in ways that are misleading in an attempt to attract young consumers. The ingredients on the back of a product should reveal its true contents, but even the nutrition labels are often confusing and difficult to comprehend.

App Overview:


Nutria, has been created with the hope of allowing both teens and adults to make informed decisions about the food products they are consuming. The goal of the application is to prevent kids and adults from making poor decisions when it comes to their health by informing them of what actually goes into their product. Users are given the opportunity to scan ingredient labels and then are given a plethora of information about each ingredient, including its type and a detailed description. Additionally, users can enter any life threatening allergies, and Nutria will immediately notify the user if their product contains this allergen.
